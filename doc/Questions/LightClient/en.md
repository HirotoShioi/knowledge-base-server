## Answer
Daedalus is what is known as a "full" or "thick" client. Daedalus is running the Cardano protocol and participating directly in the network. Full clients are usually unable to run on a mobile operating system. Later, Cardano will also have "light" or "thin" clients. Light clients only hold transaction information and private keys, and interact indirectly with the protocol, usually through a service or public network node. Light clients have their own unique security concerns and are a little further along on the [Cardano roadmap](https://cardanoroadmap.com/).
