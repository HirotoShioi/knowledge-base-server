## Answer
Transactions are made of “senders” and “receivers”, sometimes “from” and “to”.

When you click receive on Daedalus you will have the option to click your receiving address to give to someone or an exchange or generate a new address to give out.

When you click send on Daedalus, you will have a form to paste an address to send to, along with the amount you would like to send.

After you enter the information and click send, the transaction is made and sent to the network.

To see the transaction, click on the transaction in your transaction list which can be found on the summary tab or the transaction tab. Here you will see:

- Ada Sent: the time it was sent
- From Address: The address in your wallet the transaction was sent from.
- To Address: Here, you will see two addresses. One is the address you sent to, and the other is the ‘change’ address. 
- Transaction ID: This number can be used in the cardanoexplorer.com to find your transaction. If you don’t see it on the explorer, you transaction did not go through.

What is a change address?
Sometimes you only need to send a smaller amount than you have stored in your address. All funds must be spent from the address, so two transactions are made. One to the receiving address and one back to your wallet. This is done to an unused address in your wallet for security reasons. 

Exchanges
Exchanges have requirement for number of transactions before approving the coins for trading. This is because forks can happen, and they need to ensure they control the coins before allowing them to trade.

In addition, sometimes a transaction is not seen in the network for various reasons. If you do not see your transaction in the exchange, please check [cardanoexplorer.com](https://cardanoexplorer.com)
